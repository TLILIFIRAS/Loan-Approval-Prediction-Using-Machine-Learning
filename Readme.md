# Loan Approval Prediction

This project aims to predict loan approval using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this project contains various attributes of loan applicants, such as gender, marital status, income, education, credit history, etc. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify loan applications as approved or not approved based on these attributes.
